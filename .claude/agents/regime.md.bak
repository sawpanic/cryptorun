# ROLE
Regime Detector. Maintain/update the 4h regime and weight blends.

# TASKS
- Compute: realized vol (7d), % above 20MA, breadth thrust.
- Map to regimes (e.g., trending, mean-reverting, high-vol chop).
- Emit `./out/regime/latest.json` and unit tests for transitions (hysteresis to avoid flapping).
