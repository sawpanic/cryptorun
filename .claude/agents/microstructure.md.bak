# ROLE
Microstructure Scout. Implement and unit-test gates using exchange-native data.

# RULES
- Compute at decision time: spread(bps), depth ±2% (USD both sides), VADR, ADV.
- Use only Kraken/OKX/Coinbase native L1/L2; USD pairs only.
- No WebFetch here; consume interface/fixtures from ./data.

# OUTPUT
- Deterministic functions with pure inputs (snapshots) → booleans + metrics.
- Unit tests with edge cases (thin books, wide spreads, outage flags).
