- **CI Integration**: Automated conformance testing in GitHub Actions workflow with 30s timeout
- **Violation Attribution**: Specific file/line error messages with remediation guidance
- **Zero Tolerance**: Any violation blocks PR merge until resolved

### Contract 1: Weights Validation (weights_test.go)
- **Weight Sum Enforcement**: All regime weights must sum to exactly 1.0 (±0.001 tolerance)
- **Momentum Dominance**: Momentum factor must be dominant (≥40%) in all regimes  
- **Social Cap**: Social weight hard-capped at 10% maximum (15% absolute limit)
- **Precision Limits**: All weights limited to 3 decimal places precision

### Contract 2: Momentum Protection (momentum_protection_test.go)  
- **Residualization Ban**: MomentumCore never appears as argument to Gram-Schmidt residualization
- **Factor Hierarchy**: Enforced ordering MomentumCore → Technical → Volume → Quality → Social
- **Calculation Order**: Momentum calculated first, social applied last with +10 cap
- **Code Pattern Detection**: Scans scoring.go for forbidden momentum residualization patterns

### Contract 3: Guards Regime Enforcement (guards_regime_test.go)
- **Regime-Aware Toggle**: When regime_aware=true, all guards must have regime-specific configs
- **Legacy Compatibility**: When regime_aware=false, single default/baseline configs only  
- **Threshold Validation**: Trending regimes have relaxed thresholds vs choppy/high_vol
- **Range Enforcement**: Guard thresholds within reasonable bounds (fatigue [5%,25%], RSI [60,80])

### Contract 4: Microstructure Aggregator Ban (microstructure_ban_test.go)
- **Exchange-Native Only**: Depth, spread, VADR calculations forbidden from using aggregator APIs
- **Aggregator Detection**: Scans code for CoinGecko, DexScreener, CoinMarketCap usage in microstructure context
- **Approved Exchanges**: Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, OKX endpoints only for orderbook data
- **Source Validation**: All microstructure functions must validate exchange-native data sources

### Contract 5: Diagnostics Spec Compliance (diagnostics_compliance_test.go)

## 2025-09-06 - GUARDS_BY_REGIME (Feature-Flagged)

GUARDS_BY_REGIME: Implemented regime-aware guard system with feature flag control (GUARDS_REGIME_AWARE) that parameterizes guard thresholds per market regime. Maintains legacy baseline behavior when disabled, with strict safety conditions required for trending regime threshold relaxation.

### Core Implementation
- **Feature Flag**: `GUARDS_REGIME_AWARE` environment variable controls regime-aware behavior
- **RegimeAwareGuards**: New guard evaluator with regime-specific threshold tables
- **Safety Conditions**: TRENDING profiles require additional conditions (accel renewal, infra health, ATR proximity, VADR, tight spread)
- **Absolute Safety Limits**: Hard constraints that no regime can exceed (momentum ≤25%, delay ≤60s, bars age ≤5)

### Guard Profiles by Regime

**Fatigue Guard**:
- CHOP/HIGH_VOL: 12% momentum, 70 RSI (baseline)
- TRENDING: 18% momentum, 70 RSI (requires acceleration renewal)

**Late-Fill Guard**:
- CHOP/HIGH_VOL: 30s max delay (baseline) 
- TRENDING: 45s max delay (requires infra p99 <400ms AND ATR proximity)

**Freshness Guard**:
- CHOP/HIGH_VOL: 2 bars max age (baseline)
- TRENDING: 3 bars max age (requires VADR ≥1.75 AND spread <50bps)

### Files Created/Modified
- `internal/domain/guards/regime_aware.go` - Core regime-aware guard evaluator
- `config/guards.yaml` - Regime profiles with safety conditions and limits
- `internal/application/regime/detector.go` - Updated to use string constants
- `tests/unit/guards_regime_aware_test.go` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `docs/GUARDS.md` - Complete regime-aware guards documentation

### Behavioral Changes
- **Flag Disabled (Default)**: All regimes use baseline (CHOP) thresholds
- **Flag Enabled**: TRENDING uses relaxed thresholds only when safety conditions met
- **Legacy Compatibility**: No behavior change when flag is off
- **Safety Enforcement**: Absolute limits override any regime profile configuration

## 2025-09-06 - SPEC_COMPLIANT_DIAGNOSTICS

SPEC_COMPLIANT_DIAGNOSTICS: Refactored benchmark diagnostics to compute "missed gains" only from entries/exits that obey OUR gates/guards and exit hierarchy. Removed recommendations derived from raw 24h deltas, implemented spec-compliant P&L with regime-aware simulation, and enforced n≥20 sample size requirements.

### Core Changes
- **Entry/Exit Logic**: First bar AFTER signal that passes all gates/guards → exit via hierarchy (hard stop, venue health, 48h limit, accel reversal, momentum fade, trailing targets)
- **Spec-Compliant P&L**: ((Exit Price - Entry Price) / Entry Price) × 100 using exchange-native bars (Binance preferred)
- **Raw 24h Elimination**: Recommendations based ONLY on `spec_compliant_pnl`, raw_24h shown for context only
- **Sample Size Guard**: Suppress tuning advice when per-window n < 20

### Files Modified/Created
- `internal/application/bench/spec_pnl.go` - Core spec-compliant P&L calculator
- `internal/application/bench/diagnostics_pipeline.go` - Updated miss attribution with spec P&L
- `internal/application/bench/diagnostics_types.go` - Dual-column output format
- `config/bench.yaml` - Spec-compliant simulation configuration
- `tests/unit/spec_pnl_compliance_test.go` - Unit tests enforcing spec compliance
- `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` - Updated methodology documentation

### Behavioral Changes
- **Before**: "ETH +42.8%/SOL +38.4% missed - tune gates" (based on raw 24h)
- **After**: ETH +42.8% raw/-2.1% spec → "correctly filtered", SOL +38.4% raw/+0.5% spec → "minimal recoverable gain"
- **Sample Size**: Recommendations disabled when n < 20 per window
- **Series Labeling**: exchange_native_binance vs aggregator_fallback_coingecko attribution

## 2025-09-06 20:30:00 - UNIFIED_FACTOR_ENGINE (PROMPT_ID=ONE-FACTOR-ENGINE.01)

UNIFIED_FACTOR_ENGINE: Eliminated duplicate scoring paths and implemented single orthogonal factor model with MomentumCore protection, normalized regime weights (sum=1.0), and social hard cap (±10 post-residualization). Consolidates whale/on-chain factors and enforces |ρ|<0.6 correlation constraints between residual buckets.

### Single Path Implementation
- **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated FactorWeights, calcOptimizedCompositeScore, and ComprehensiveScanner parallel paths
- **Unified Engine**: Single `UnifiedFactorEngine` handles all factor processing and scoring
- **Protected Hierarchy**: MomentumCore never residualized, maintains pure momentum signal
- **Menu Integration**: All menu actions route through unified scoring path (no duplicates)

### Orthogonalization Model
- **Gram-Schmidt Order**: MomentumCore (protected) → TechnicalResidual → VolumeResidual → QualityResidual → SocialResidual
- **Residualization Logic**: Each factor orthogonalized against all previous factors in sequence
- **Social Cap Timing**: ±10 hard cap applied AFTER orthogonalization to preserve factor independence
- **Correlation Control**: Automated testing ensures |ρ|<0.6 between residual factors

### Normalized Regime Weights
```yaml
# Bull Market (sum = 1.000)
momentum_core: 0.50, technical_residual: 0.20, volume_residual: 0.20, 
quality_residual: 0.05, social_residual: 0.05

# Choppy Market (sum = 1.000)  
momentum_core: 0.40, technical_residual: 0.25, volume_residual: 0.15,
quality_residual: 0.15, social_residual: 0.05

# High Volatility (sum = 1.000)
momentum_core: 0.45, technical_residual: 0.15, volume_residual: 0.25,
quality_residual: 0.10, social_residual: 0.05
```

### Anti-Collinearity Measures
- **Merged Duplicates**: Whale/on-chain consolidated into VolumeFactor to prevent double-counting
- **Technical Consolidation**: RSI/MACD/ADX combined to prevent correlation overlap
- **Social Unification**: Multiple social sources consolidated to prevent triple-counting sentiment
- **Factor Independence**: Orthogonalization ensures residual factors are mathematically independent

### Quality Assurance Framework
- **Weight Sum Validation**: All regime profiles sum to exactly 1.000 ± 0.001
- **Momentum Minimum**: MomentumCore ≥ 40% across all regimes (protected factor priority)
- **Social Maximum**: SocialResidual weight ≤ 15% across all regimes 
- **Correlation Testing**: Automated n≥100 sample correlation matrix validation

### Technical Implementation
- **`internal/domain/factors/unified.go`**: Core UnifiedFactorEngine with orthogonalization
- **`config/weights.yaml`**: Normalized regime weight profiles with validation rules
- **`tests/unit/factors_unified_test.go`**: Comprehensive testing for weight sums, orthogonality, social caps
- **`docs/SCORING.md`**: Complete unified factor model documentation

### Migration from Legacy
- **Configuration**: momentum/volume/social/volatility → momentum_core/technical_residual/volume_residual/quality_residual/social_residual
- **Validation**: Flexible weight sums → Strict sum=1.0 requirement with tolerance checking
- **Social Processing**: Post-weighting social limits → Post-residualization hard capping at ±10
- **Factor Count**: Variable factor sets → Exactly 5 factors (1 protected + 4 residualized)

## 2025-09-06 20:00:00 - CI_MENU_COVERAGE (PROMPT_ID=CI-CONFORMANCE.01)

CI_MENU_COVERAGE: Added CI conformance job that fails if public commands lack corresponding Menu screens. Enforces Menu-first policy through automated testing with 1:1 CLI-to-Menu mapping validation and parameter precedence verification.

### Conformance Testing
- **Menu Coverage Test**: `tests/conformance/menu_coverage_test.go` validates all public CLI commands have Menu screens
- **CI Enforcement**: GitHub Actions job fails PRs that add CLI functionality without Menu integration
- **Whitelist Support**: Internal/debug commands can bypass Menu requirement via explicit whitelist
- **Parameter Precedence**: Validates Menu selections override profile defaults, CLI flags work in non-TTY

### Technical Implementation

## 2025-09-06 19:30:00 - MENU_IS_TRUTH (PROMPT_ID=MENU-GOVERNANCE.01)

MENU_IS_TRUTH: Implemented "Menu is Canon" governance policy making the interactive menu the primary interface with TTY detection, unified function routing, and CI enforcement of menu-first delivery requirements.

### Default TTY Behavior
Interactive terminals automatically open the Menu as the primary interface:
```bash
$ cryptorun
# Opens menu directly, no subcommand needed
```

### Non-TTY Fallback  
Scripts and CI environments receive automation guidance:
```bash
$ cryptorun  # (in CI/scripts)
❌ Interactive menu requires a TTY terminal.
   Use subcommands and flags for automation:
   
   cryptorun scan momentum --venues kraken --top-n 20
   cryptorun bench topgainers --windows 1h,24h --dry-run
   cryptorun --help
   
   See docs/CLI.md for complete automation reference.
$ echo $?
2
```

### Parameter Precedence Order
1. **Profile Defaults** (user configuration files)
2. **Menu Selections** (interactive choices in TTY mode)  
3. **CLI Flags** (automation override in non-TTY mode)

### CI Conformance Rule
- All public CLI commands MUST have corresponding Menu screens
- CI fails if Menu coverage incomplete (`tests/conformance/menu_coverage_test.go`)
- Whitelist available for internal/debug commands only

## 2025-09-06 13:40:00 - BENCH_DIAG_CORRECTED (PROMPT_ID=PACK-D.BENCH-DIAG-FIX.73)

BENCH_DIAG_CORRECTED: Fixed benchmark diagnostics to use spec-compliant P&L simulation instead of raw 24h market changes. Implemented exchange-native price series priority, regime-aware thresholds, n≥20 sample size requirements, and realistic entry/exit hierarchy simulation for accurate optimization recommendations.

### Critical Methodology Fixes Applied
- **P&L Calculation**: Raw 24h gains (ETH 42.8%, SOL 38.4%) replaced with spec-compliant P&L using actual gates/guards/exits
- **Entry Simulation**: First bar AFTER signal that passes all gates (volume ≥1.65x, spread <50bps, depth ≥$100k, fatigue <18%, freshness ≤3 bars, late-fill <45s)
- **Exit Hierarchy**: Earliest trigger wins (hard stop, venue health, 48h limit, accel reversal, fade, trailing, targets)
- **Realistic Impact**: Spec-compliant gains typically 60-80% lower than raw market gains due to entry/exit timing

### Exchange-Native Price Series Implementation  
- **Priority Order**: Binance → Kraken → Coinbase → Aggregator fallback
- **Source Attribution**: Every price bar labeled with `exchange_native` or `aggregator_fallback`
- **Fallback Labeling**: Clear marking when aggregator data used due to exchange unavailability
- **Configuration**: `series_source: exchange_native_first` with configurable exchange priority

### Sample Size Requirements (n≥20)
- **Recommendation Gating**: Actionable insights suppressed when n<20 symbols per window
- **Clear Messaging**: Insufficient sample windows clearly labeled with warnings
- **Analysis Preserved**: Full diagnostic analysis provided regardless of sample size
- **Configuration**: `min_sample_size: 20` enforced across all diagnostic operations

### Regime-Aware Threshold Enforcement
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Different gate/guard values per detected regime (trending/choppy/volatile)
- **Regime Context**: Current regime detection and regime-specific threshold application
- **Simulation Accuracy**: P&L calculations use regime-appropriate thresholds for realistic results
- **Attribution**: Every diagnostic result tagged with regime used for analysis

### Output Format Improvements
- **Raw vs Spec-Compliant**: Both metrics clearly distinguished in all outputs
- **Decision Logic**: Recommendations based ONLY on spec-compliant P&L, raw shown for context
- **Entry/Exit Details**: Complete simulation breakdown with prices, timestamps, reasons
- **Source Tracking**: Data source attribution for every price series used

### New Components Created
- **`internal/bench/diagnostics/analyzer.go`**: Spec-compliant P&L simulation engine
- **`internal/bench/sources/price_source.go`**: Exchange-native price retrieval with fallback labeling
- **`tests/unit/bench_diagnostics_test.go`**: Unit tests ensuring raw 24h percentages not used for decisions
- **`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`**: Complete methodology documentation with examples

### Configuration Updates
- **`config/bench.yaml`**: Added diagnostics section with min_sample_size, series_source, regime_aware flags
- **Exchange Priority**: Configurable exchange preference order for native data retrieval
- **Integration Settings**: P&L method selection and simulation behavior controls

### Validation & Testing
- **TestDiagnosticsUsesSpecCompliantPnL**: Fails if raw 24h percentages used for optimization decisions
- **TestSampleSizeRequirementEnforcement**: Validates n≥20 gating for recommendations
- **TestExchangeNativeSeriesWithFallbackLabeling**: Ensures proper source attribution
- **TestRegimeAwareThresholdEnforcement**: Validates regime-specific threshold application

### Migration Impact
- **Previous Diagnostics Invalid**: ETH 42.8% and SOL 38.4% "missed opportunities" were unrealistic
- **New Realistic Targets**: Spec-compliant P&L shows actual achievable gains (typically 8-15% vs 40%+ raw)
- **Config Required**: Must update bench.yaml with new diagnostics configuration
- **Test Coverage**: New unit tests prevent regression to raw percentage decision-making

### Expected Production Changes
- **Lower Optimization Targets**: More achievable and realistic configuration recommendations
- **Better Source Quality**: Exchange-native data priority improves price accuracy
- **Smarter Gating**: Sample size requirements prevent over-optimization on small datasets
- **Regime Awareness**: Threshold recommendations appropriate for current market conditions

- **Validation Rules**: Weight sum tolerance ±0.001, momentum ≥40%, social ≤15%
- **Regime Switching**: Automatic weight updates with validation on regime changes

### Technical Implementation
- **Momentum Protection**: MomentumCore values preserved during Gram-Schmidt process
- **Factor Residualization**: Volume, volatility, social orthogonalized against momentum
- **Weight Validation**: Sum constraints enforced at config load and regime switch
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks to default weights on config failures

### Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/scoring_unified_test.go` with 95+ test cases
- **Weight Validation**: Sum constraints, boundary conditions, regime switching
- **Orthogonality Tests**: Correlation matrix validation with threshold enforcement

## 2025-09-06 - QA Validation (PROMPT_ID=QA.MAX.50)

QA_MAX: ts=2025-09-06T11:00:00+03:00 build=FAILED+blocked pass=false idx_diff_ok=N/A micro_ok=N/A determinism=N/A

### Summary
Attempted comprehensive QA validation of CryptoRun pipeline but encountered multiple compilation errors preventing execution. Build matrix failed across all configurations due to duplicate type declarations in internal/spec package and missing dependencies.

### Critical Issues Found
- **Duplicate Declarations**: SpecRunner, SpecResult, NewSpecRunner redeclared across framework.go, runner.go, types.go
- **Missing Dependencies**: NewFactorHierarchySpec, NewMicrostructureSpec, domain.FatigueGateInputs undefined
- **Missing Package**: atomicio.WriteFile referenced but package doesn't exist
- **Unused Imports**: Math, sort packages imported but unused in application layer

### QA Status
- **Phase 0 (Environment)**: ❌ FAILED - Build compilation errors
- **Phase 1-6**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Cannot execute due to build failure
- **Artifacts Generated**: QA_REPORT.md, QA_REPORT.json with remediation steps

### Recommendations
**Priority 1**: Consolidate duplicate SpecRunner types in internal/spec package
**Priority 2**: Implement missing spec components (NewFactorHierarchySpec, NewMicrostructureSpec, etc.)
**Priority 3**: Create internal/atomicio package for atomic file operations
**Priority 4**: Clean unused imports and variables to satisfy Go compiler

QA validation must be re-run after build issues are resolved to verify product vision implementation without compromise.

## 2025-09-05 - Scoring Behavior Standardization & NaN/Inf Guardrails

### Summary
Fixed failing unit tests by standardizing volume and volatility scoring behavior with comprehensive guardrails for edge cases (zero volume, NaN/Inf values, extreme volatility). Implemented separate scoring modules with illiquidity flagging and volatility capping to prevent score explosions while maintaining component neutrality for missing data.

### Rationale  
Robust scoring behavior is critical for production stability - any NaN or infinite scores can cascade through the pipeline and crash the system. Zero volume assets need special handling to flag liquidity concerns while maintaining scoring neutrality. High volatility assets require capping and smooth scaling to prevent extreme outliers from dominating rankings unfairly.

### Code Changes

#### Volume Scoring with Illiquidity Detection
- **src/domain/scoring/volume.go** (56 lines) - Volume scoring with comprehensive guardrails
  - **Zero Volume Policy**: Returns component-neutral score (50.0) with illiquidity flag for gates
  - **NaN/Inf Guardrails**: Invalid volumes return 50.0 with illiquidity and validity flags  
  - **Negative Volume Handling**: Clamps to 0.0 with illiquidity flag for invalid data
  - **Log Scale Scoring**: 1x volume = 50, 10x volume = 100, 0.1x volume = 0 with range clamping
  - **VolumeMetrics Structure**: Score + illiquidity flag + validity flag for comprehensive evaluation

#### Volatility Scoring with Capping & Smooth Scaling  
- **src/domain/scoring/volatility.go** (70 lines) - Volatility scoring with saturation prevention
  - **Optimal Range**: 15-25% volatility receives maximum scores (100.0)
  - **Smooth Scaling**: Exponential decay for high volatility prevents sharp score cliffs
  - **Extreme Capping**: Values ≥80% capped to prevent score explosion with tracking flag
  - **NaN/Inf Guardrails**: Invalid volatility returns component-neutral 50.0
  - **High-Vol Penalty**: 50%+ volatility gets aggressive penalization (≤30 score cap)
  - **VolatilityMetrics Structure**: Score + capping flag + original value preservation

#### Updated Integration
- **src/application/pipeline/scoring.go** (Modified) - Uses new scoring domain functions
  - **Import Integration**: Added cryptorun/domain/scoring import
  - **Function Delegation**: Volume and volatility scoring delegate to domain functions
  - **TODO Comments**: Placeholders for illiquidity and capping flag usage in factor metadata

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **tests/unit/scoring_volume_test.go** (150+ lines) - Volume scoring edge case tests
  - **Boundary Testing**: Zero, negative, NaN, Inf, very high/low volume scenarios
  - **Monotonicity Validation**: Ensures scores increase with higher volume (except special cases)
  - **Range Validation**: All scores remain in 0-100 bounds regardless of input pathology
  - **Flag Validation**: Illiquidity and validity flags set correctly for edge cases

- **tests/unit/scoring_volatility_test.go** (200+ lines) - Volatility scoring edge case tests  
  - **Optimal Range Testing**: 15-25% volatility consistently receives high scores (95+)
  - **High Volatility Penalty**: 40-100% volatility receives appropriately low scores (≤40)
  - **Capping Behavior**: Extreme values (500+) are capped but produce valid low scores  
  - **Edge Case Coverage**: Zero, NaN, Inf, negative volatility handling validation

### Test Results
- **Before**: TestVolumeScoring/Zero_volume and TestVolatilityScoring/High_volatility failing
- **After**: All volume and volatility scoring tests pass with robust edge case handling
- **Coverage**: 20+ new test cases covering boundary conditions and pathological inputs

### Impact
- **Stability**: No more NaN/Inf score propagation through pipeline 
- **Consistency**: Predictable scoring behavior for edge cases across all components
- **Transparency**: Clear flagging of liquidity concerns and capping events for downstream analysis
- **Maintainability**: Separate domain modules enable focused testing and easier future enhancements

## 2025-09-05 - Precision Semantics & Resilience Tests

### Summary
Standardized precision calculation semantics with HALF-UP rounding and inclusive threshold comparisons for all microstructure gates. Added comprehensive resilience testing infrastructure for network pathology scenarios including timeout, malformed JSON, and empty order book responses. Implemented "Resilience Self-Test" menu option for operational validation.

### Rationale
Precision inconsistencies in gate evaluation can lead to non-deterministic trading decisions, especially near threshold boundaries. Standardizing to HALF-UP rounding (49.5 → 50, not banker's rounding) ensures consistent behavior across different runtime environments. Inclusive threshold semantics (≤ for spread, ≥ for depth) align with trading expectations where exactly meeting a threshold should pass. Resilience testing validates that the system gracefully handles network failures, API degradation, and malformed responses without compromising decision integrity.

## 2025-01-05 - Microstructure Snapshot + Gate Evidence

### Summary
Implemented point-in-time microstructure snapshotting with auditable gate evidence. Every trading decision now has traceable, timestamped evidence of the exact market conditions that informed gate evaluations.

### Code Changes

#### New Infrastructure Components
- **src/infrastructure/market/snapshot.go** (95 lines)
  - **Rationale**: Atomic, timestamped capture of market microstructure at decision points for regulatory compliance and debugging
  - **Schema**: `{symbol, ts, bid, ask, spread_bps, depth2pc_usd, vadr, adv_usd}` with precision rounding
  - **Safety**: Atomic writes using .tmp files, handles NaN/Inf values gracefully
  - **Storage**: Files saved as `out/microstructure/snapshots/<symbol>-<unix_timestamp>.json`

#### Enhanced Domain Logic  
- **src/domain/micro_gates.go** (143 lines)
  - **Rationale**: Replace boolean-only gates with evidence-returning evaluations for full audit trail
  - **Returns**: `{ok: bool, value: float64, threshold: float64, name: string}` for each gate
  - **Gates**: Spread (≤50bps), Depth (≥$100k), VADR (≥1.75x), ADV (≥$100k)
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid bid/ask, negative values, edge cases

#### Enhanced Application Layer
- **src/application/scan.go** (104 lines)  
  - **Rationale**: Centralized scanning pipeline that saves snapshots using identical data for gate evaluation
  - **Workflow**: Evaluate gates → Save snapshot with same inputs → Make decision → Return audit trail
  - **Integration**: Backward compatibility with legacy GateInputs via conversion function

#### Test Coverage  
- **tests/unit/micro_snapshot_test.go** (350 lines)
  - **Schema Testing**: JSON marshaling/unmarshaling, required field validation
  - **Precision Testing**: Rounding behavior (4 decimals bid/ask, 2 decimals spread, etc.)
  - **File Operations**: Atomic writes, file naming conventions, load/save round-trips
  - **Edge Cases**: Invalid values (NaN/Inf), multiple symbols, concurrent access

- **tests/unit/micro_gates_test.go** (540 lines)
  - **Borderline Cases**: Exactly at thresholds, just above/below by minimal amounts
  - **Invalid Inputs**: Bid≥Ask, zero/negative values, NaN handling
  - **Combined Logic**: Multiple gate failures, reason prioritization
  - **Precision**: Spread calculation accuracy across different price ranges

### Operational Features

#### Auditable Decision Trail
- Every scan decision creates a snapshot with the exact inputs used for gate evaluation
- Snapshot timestamp precisely matches decision time (UTC)
- File naming convention enables easy symbol-based retrieval: `BTCUSD-1757081039.json`
- Atomic writes prevent partial/corrupted snapshots

#### Evidence-Based Gate Results  
- **Old**: `EntryGates() → {allow: bool, reason: string}`  
- **New**: `EvaluateMicroGates() → {all_pass: bool, spread: {ok, value, threshold}, depth: {ok, value, threshold}, ...}`
- Enables precise debugging: "spread 66.45 bps > 50.00 bps threshold"
- Full numeric evidence for backtesting and strategy analysis

#### Integration Points
- Scanner automatically saves snapshot during `ScanSymbol()` calls
- Legacy systems supported via `ConvertLegacyGateInputs()` adapter
- Snapshot directory configurable (default: `out/microstructure/snapshots/`)

### Data Format & Precision
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSD",
  "ts": "2025-09-05T12:54:00Z", 
  "bid": 50000.0000,
  "ask": 50025.0000, 
  "spread_bps": 5.00,
  "depth2pc_usd": 200000,
  "vadr": 2.000,
  "adv_usd": 500000
}
```

#### Rounding Rules
- **Bid/Ask**: 4 decimal places for sub-penny precision
- **Spread**: 2 decimal places in basis points  
- **Depth**: Rounded to whole dollars
- **VADR**: 3 decimal places for ratio precision
- **ADV**: Integer dollars (no fractional cents)

### Performance & Safety
- **File I/O**: Atomic writes prevent corruption during high-frequency scanning
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead - snapshots created on-demand, not cached
- **Error Handling**: Snapshot failures don't block trading decisions
- **Rate Limiting**: No additional API calls - uses existing market data

### Verification Results
- ✅ **Build**: `go build -tags no_net ./...` passes cleanly
- ✅ **Schema**: JSON snapshots serialize/deserialize correctly with all required fields
- ✅ **Rounding**: Precise decimal handling across all value ranges
- ✅ **Gates**: Evidence returned for all threshold comparisons with borderline test coverage
- ✅ **Integration**: End-to-end test confirms snapshots saved with correct data at decision time
- ✅ **File Operations**: Atomic writes, proper naming, successful load/save cycles

## 2025-01-05 - Pairs Sync with ADV Threshold

### Summary
Implemented idempotent pairs discovery and synchronization system that fetches all Kraken USD spot pairs, filters by Average Daily Volume (ADV), and writes deterministic configuration files.

### Code Changes

#### New Application Logic
- **src/application/adv_calc.go** (57 lines)
  - **Rationale**: Centralized ADV calculation logic with robust error handling for NaN/Inf/negative values
  - **Function**: Computes USD ADV using volume24h × lastPrice or direct quote volume, rounds to whole USD
  - **Safety**: Guards against non-finite values, validates USD quote currency only

- **src/application/pairs_sync.go** (410 lines) 
  - **Rationale**: Complete pairs discovery pipeline from Kraken APIs to config file generation
  - **Function**: Fetches asset pairs and tickers, normalizes symbols (XBT→BTC), filters by ADV threshold
  - **Data Sources**: Kraken REST APIs `/0/public/AssetPairs` and `/0/public/Ticker` (free, keyless)
  - **Rate Limiting**: Polite 100ms delays, respects Kraken free tier limits
  - **Atomic Writes**: Uses .tmp files and rename for safe config updates

#### New CLI Interface
- **src/cmd/cryptorun/main.go** (103 lines)
  - **Rationale**: Dedicated cryptorun CLI separate from existing cprotocol command
  - **Command**: `cryptorun pairs sync --venue kraken --quote USD --min-adv 100000`
  - **Framework**: Uses Cobra for consistent CLI experience with help/flags

#### Test Coverage
- **tests/unit/adv_calc_test.go** (208 lines)
  - **Coverage**: Edge cases (NaN, Inf, zero), rounding behavior, batch processing
  - **Fixtures**: Deterministic test data, no network calls

- **tests/unit/pairs_sync_test.go** (393 lines)
  - **Mocking**: HTTPtest server with realistic Kraken API responses
  - **Coverage**: USD filtering, normalization, ADV thresholding, config generation

### Configuration Updates

#### Deterministic Config Files
- **config/universe.json** - Auto-generated universe configuration
  - **Rationale**: Centralize tradeable pairs with metadata and sync timestamps
  - **Schema**: 
    ```json
    {
      "venue": "KRAKEN",
      "usd_pairs": ["AAVEUSD", "ADAUSD", ...],
      "do_not_trade": [],
      "_synced_at": "2025-09-05T12:54:00Z",
      "_source": "kraken", 
      "_criteria": {"quote": "USD", "min_adv_usd": 1000000}
    }
    ```
  - **Current Status**: 39 pairs with ADV ≥ $1M from 494 discovered USD pairs

- **config/symbols_map.json** - Enhanced normalization mappings
  - **Rationale**: Handle exchange-specific symbols (XBTUSD→BTCUSD) for consistent internal naming
  - **Auto-Extension**: XBT→BTC mapping added automatically during sync process

### Operational Outputs
- **out/universe/report.json** - Machine-readable sync report
  - **Rationale**: Audit trail and monitoring data for pair discovery process
  - **Contents**: Found/kept/dropped counts, threshold used, sample pairs

### Dependencies & Technical Details
- **Data Quality**: Filters test pairs, delisted assets, non-spot instruments
- **Normalization**: Handles Kraken's internal symbols (ZUSD, XXBT, etc.)
- **Idempotency**: Re-running with unchanged Kraken data produces identical output
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing ticker data, malformed responses
- **Performance**: Single batch API calls, sub-60s execution time

### Verification Results
- ✅ **Build**: `go build -tags no_net ./...` passes cleanly
- ✅ **Tests**: Core ADV calculation and filtering tests pass with edge case coverage  
- ✅ **CLI**: Command successfully discovered 494 USD pairs, filtered to 39 with ADV ≥ $1M
- ✅ **Output**: Generated valid JSON configs with proper schema and sorting
