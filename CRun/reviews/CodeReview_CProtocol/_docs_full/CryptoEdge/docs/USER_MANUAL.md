## 🔧 CONFIGURATION

### **API Key Setup (Optional):**
For enhanced data accuracy, configure API keys:

```cmd
# CoinMarketCap Pro API (recommended)
set CMC_API_KEY=your-cmc-pro-api-key-here

# LiveCoinWatch API (secondary)
set LIVECOINWATCH_API_KEY=your-livecoinwatch-key

# CoinLib API (tertiary)
set COINLIB_API_KEY=your-coinlib-key
```

### **Without API Keys:**
- System uses CoinGecko as fallback data source
- Clear labeling: "[CoinGecko]" vs "[CMC]"
- Honest transparency about data sources
- Full functionality maintained

### **Threshold Customization:**
```cmd
# Ultra-Alpha threshold (default: 25.0)
set CRYPTOEDGE_ULTRA_THRESHOLD=30.0

# Custom scanning parameters
set CRYPTOEDGE_MAX_POSITIONS=15
set CRYPTOEDGE_RISK_PER_TRADE=0.035
```

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues:**

#### **"No opportunities found meeting threshold criteria"**
```
Cause: Market in consolidation, threshold too high, or limited data
Solutions:
• Threshold already optimized to 35.0 for better capture
• Try different scanner modes (Social Trading for volatile periods)
• Check that API data sources are accessible
• Consider running during high volatility periods
```

#### **Application won't start**
```
Cause: Missing dependencies, permission issues, or corrupted executable
Solutions:
• Run as Administrator
• Check Windows Defender exclusions
• Verify all package files extracted properly
• Review system requirements
```

#### **"Using CoinGecko fallback" messages**
```
Cause: CMC_API_KEY not configured (this is normal)
Solutions:
• This is expected behavior without CMC API key
• System provides honest labeling of data sources
• Full functionality available with CoinGecko data
• Optional: Configure CMC API key for enhanced accuracy
```

#### **Scanner takes too long**
```
Cause: Network latency, large dataset, or system resources
Solutions:
• Target completion time: <90 seconds for Complete Factors Scan
• Check internet connection stability
• Close other applications to free resources
• Consider running during off-peak hours
```

### **Performance Expectations:**
- **Complete Factors Scan:** <90 seconds
- **Other scanner modes:** <60 seconds
- **Menu navigation:** Instant response
- **Memory usage:** <500MB during operation
