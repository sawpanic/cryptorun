# DEPRECATED SCANNERS - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

The following scanners have been deprecated due to factor collinearity issues:

1. Social Trading - 50% sentiment weight caused instability
2. Complete Factors - 124.8% weight sum (mathematical error)  
3. Enhanced Matrix - Double counting whale/sentiment factors
4. ComprehensiveScanner - Legacy ScoringWeights system
5. FactorWeights - Legacy factor system with overlaps

## ACTIVE SCANNERS (Unified Orthogonal Engine):
- Ultra-Alpha: High conviction, fast features
- Balanced: Risk-adjusted returns, smooth curve
- Sweet Spot: Range/chop optimized

All active scanners use clean 100% weight sums and orthogonal factors.
