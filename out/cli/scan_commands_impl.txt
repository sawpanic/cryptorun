CLI BATCH A1: Adding momentum|dip scan subcommands to main.go

Current scan command structure:
- scanCmd (general scan command)
- Need to add: momentum and dip subcommands
- Add common flags: --venues, --max-sample, --ttl, --progress

Implementation plan:
1. Add momentumCmd and dipCmd as subcommands to scanCmd
2. Move existing scan flags to be shared
3. Add specific implementation functions
4. Ensure progress streaming and output to out/scan/
