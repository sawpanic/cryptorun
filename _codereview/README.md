# Code Review Snapshots

This directory contains static snapshots from code review processes. These directories are ignored by Go tooling (due to the underscore prefix) and should not be used for builds or tests.

## Contents

- `CryptoEdge/` - Code review snapshot, preserved as read-only artifact

These snapshots are maintained for reference purposes only and do not participate in the active development workflow.
