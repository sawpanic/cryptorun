## Summary

Successfully implemented the EOD + Weekly Transparency Reports system as specified in `SCHED.REPORTS.DAILY.WEEKLY.txt`:

### âœ… Components Delivered

**Daily Reports (`internal/reports/daily.go`)**
- Decile analysis with monotonicity validation
- Exit distribution tracking (7 exit types)
- Provider budget monitoring with health states
- Reconciliation disagreement detection
- Regime summary generation

**Weekly Reports (`internal/reports/weekly.go`)**  
- 7-day roll-up analysis with executive summaries
- Heatmap data generation (score patterns, volume, regime distribution)
- Pattern detection (momentum surges, volume anomalies, regime instability)
- Daily report linking for comprehensive analysis

**Scheduler Integration**
- `report.daily` job (23:45 local time)  
- `report.weekly` job (16:00 UTC Sundays)
- Added to `config/scheduler.yaml`

**Documentation & Testing**
- Updated `docs/REPORTS.md` with comprehensive specifications
- Added transparency log entry in `ENGINEERING_TRANSPARENCY_LOG.md` 
- Created unit tests for decile monotonicity and exit distribution math

### ðŸ“Š Artifacts Generated

**Daily**: `artifacts/reports/daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}/`
- `deciles.csv` - Score bucket performance analysis
- `exits.csv` - Exit type distribution and success rates
- `providers.json` - API provider budgets and health status  
- `recon.csv` - Reconciliation disagreements and variances
- `regime.txt` - Daily regime summary and transitions

**Weekly**: `artifacts/reports/weekly/{YYYY-MM-DD}/`
- `overview.md` - Executive summary with key metrics
- `heatmaps.png` - Visual analysis placeholder (production would use charting library)
- `patterns.json` - Detected market patterns and anomalies

The system is now ready for automated transparency reporting with comprehensive KPI tracking and audit trails.
