PROMPT_ID=VERIFY.GREENWALL.SERIAL
Verify post-merge system integrity with greenwall validation.

Execute comprehensive validation:
1. Build verification (go build ./...)
2. Core test suite (go test ./internal/gates ./internal/regime ./internal/microstructure)
3. Entry gate validation with real-time checks
4. Regime detection accuracy against historical data
5. Microstructure tiered gate functionality

Generate PASS/FAIL report with detailed attribution for each component.
Flag any regressions or unexpected behavior.

PROMPT_ID=VERIFY.INTEGRATION.FULL
Full integration verification across all system components.

Test end-to-end workflows:
- Universe building with pair filtering
- Factor computation and residualization
- Composite scoring with regime adaptation
- Entry gate evaluation with microstructure validation
- Exit logic with hierarchy enforcement

Document any breaking changes or compatibility issues.
