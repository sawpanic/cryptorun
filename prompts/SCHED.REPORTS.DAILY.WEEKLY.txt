PROMPT_ID=SCHED.REPORTS.DAILY.WEEKLY — EOD + WEEKLY TRANSPARENCY PACKS

Goal
Automate EOD (23:45 local) + weekly (Sun 16:00 UTC): decile lift, exit distribution, provider budgets, reconciliation disagreements, regime summary; 7d roll-up with heatmaps + patterns.

Scope
1) Code
   - reports/daily.go → artifacts/reports/daily/{date}/(deciles.csv, exits.csv, providers.json, recon.csv, regime.txt)
   - reports/weekly.go → artifacts/reports/weekly/{date}/(overview.md, heatmaps.png, patterns.json)

2) Scheduler
   - job.report.daily   cron "45 23 * * *" (local)
   - job.report.weekly  cron "0 16 * * Sun" (UTC)

3) Docs
   - docs/REPORTS.md; ENGINEERING_TRANSPARENCY_LOG.md append.

4) Tests
   - decile monotonicity / isotonic fallback; exit distribution math; weekly links resolve.

Acceptance
- schedule list shows both; artifacts render; weekly links daily assets.
