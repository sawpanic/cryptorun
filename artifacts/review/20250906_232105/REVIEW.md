## Major Architecture Changes

### 1. Unified Composite Scoring System ✅
**Impact:** HIGH - Fundamental architecture shift
- Replaced dual-path FactorWeights system with single scoring pipeline
- Implemented protected MomentumCore that never gets orthogonalized  
- Added Gram-Schmidt residualization for Technical → Volume → Quality → Social factors
- Created comprehensive explainability system with attribution

### 2. Regime Detection System ✅  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - New market classification capability
- Implemented 4-hour regime detection with majority voting
- Added three market regimes: Trending Bull, Choppy, High Volatility
- Created regime-specific weight presets with movement gate adjustments
- Integrated timer-based automatic regime updates

### 3. Entry/Exit Gate Orchestration ✅
**Impact:** HIGH - Critical trading safeguards  
- Enforced hard entry gates: Score ≥75 + VADR ≥1.8× + funding divergence
- Implemented 7-tier exit precedence hierarchy from hard stops to profit targets
- Added comprehensive guard metrics (freshness, fatigue, proximity, late-fill)
- Created deterministic JSON reporting for stable testing

### 4. Exchange-Native Microstructure ✅
**Impact:** HIGH - Data quality enforcement
- Banned aggregator dependencies for microstructure data
- Implemented venue-native L1/L2 order book validation  
- Added spread/depth/VADR enforcement with proof generation
- Created exchange-specific rate limiting and circuit breakers

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Compilation Failures (CRITICAL)
```
src/domain/momentum/core.go:10:2: undefined: momentum
src/domain/momentum/weights.go:6:40: undefined: RegimeType  
internal/domain/factors/types.go:27:6: FactorRow redeclared
internal/domain/regime/types.go:15:6: RegimeType redeclared
```

**Root Cause:** Module structure inconsistencies and type redeclarations
**Impact:** Prevents build, test execution, and development progress
**Priority:** P0 - Must fix before any further development

### 2. Module Structure Issues (HIGH)
- Mixed import paths between `cryptorun/src/` and `cryptorun/internal/`
- Type definitions duplicated across multiple packages
- Circular dependency potential in domain layer
- Inconsistent package organization

### 3. Test Coverage Gaps (MEDIUM)  
- Cannot assess test coverage due to build failures
- New gate orchestration and regime detection need integration testing
- Exit logic precedence requires comprehensive scenario testing

## Positive Developments

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation ✅
- Added detailed API documentation for all new systems
- Created comprehensive REGIMES.md, GATES.md, and EXITS.md
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with proper version tracking
- Maintained architectural decision records

### 2. Test Infrastructure ✅
- Created extensive unit tests for regime detection and gate logic
- Implemented deterministic JSON output for stable testing  
- Added benchmark tests for performance validation
- Created mock implementations for external dependencies

### 3. Configuration Management ✅
- Externalized all thresholds and weights to YAML configuration
- Implemented regime-specific weight presets
- Added feature flags for experimental logic
- Created environment variable support for deployment

## Code Quality Observations

### Strengths
- **Consistent Go idioms:** Proper error handling and interface usage
- **Clear separation of concerns:** Domain, application, infrastructure layers
- **Comprehensive testing approach:** Unit, integration, and benchmark tests
- **Strong documentation:** API docs, architectural decisions, usage examples

### Areas for Improvement  
- **Module organization:** Resolve src/ vs internal/ structure confusion
- **Type consolidation:** Eliminate duplicate type definitions
- **Import path consistency:** Standardize import naming conventions
- **Dependency management:** Clean up unused imports and circular dependencies

## Deployment Readiness: NOT READY

### Blockers
1. **Build Failures:** Must resolve compilation errors before deployment
2. **Test Validation:** Cannot validate functionality without successful builds
3. **Integration Testing:** Need end-to-end testing of unified scoring system
4. **Performance Validation:** Require P99 latency validation (<300ms target)

### Prerequisites for Production
- [ ] Fix all compilation errors and achieve green build
- [ ] Validate test suite passes with >90% coverage  
- [ ] Complete integration testing of unified scoring pipeline
- [ ] Validate regime detection accuracy with historical data
- [ ] Performance test entry/exit gate latencies
- [ ] Load test unified composite scoring under realistic conditions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Fix Module Structure:** Consolidate src/ and internal/ organization
2. **Resolve Type Conflicts:** Eliminate duplicate type definitions  
3. **Clean Import Paths:** Standardize import naming across packages
4. **Validate Core Build:** Ensure `go build ./...` succeeds

### Short-term Actions (P1)
1. **Integration Testing:** End-to-end test of unified scoring system
2. **Performance Validation:** Benchmark regime detection and gate evaluation
3. **Data Pipeline Testing:** Validate exchange-native microstructure integration
4. **Configuration Validation:** Test all regime and weight configurations

### Medium-term Actions (P2)
1. **Production Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive observability
2. **Circuit Breaker Testing:** Validate API failure handling
3. **Cache Strategy Validation:** Test Redis integration and TTL behavior
4. **Security Review:** Validate no secrets in code, proper env var usage
