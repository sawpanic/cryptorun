# Code Review Bundle - CryptoRun

**Generated:** 2025-01-07 00:11:53  
**Bundle ID:** 20250907_001153  
**Branch:** feat/data-facade-hot-warm  

## Summary

This review bundle contains the complete code changes and analysis for the RED2GREEN+DERIVS+MICRO.V1 prompt completion, turning the repo from red (build/test errors) to green (fully building) while implementing comprehensive microstructure gates and derivatives hardening.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 🔧 Critical Fixes
- **Fixed OI Type Safety:** Converted string→float64 with `safeDelta()` function and computed 24h deltas
- **Fixed Regime Analyzer:** Eliminated float modulo operations causing build failures  
- **Fixed Test Imports:** Corrected import ordering in `premove/api_test.go`
- **Fixed Build Errors:** Resolved all critical compile-time errors

### 🏗️ Major Implementations

#### 1. Funding Divergence Gate
- **Venue-median Z logic:** 30-day window, 4h bars
- **Gate logic:** `zMed < -1.5 AND spot VWAP(24h) holds AND (spotCVD >= 0 OR perpCVD <= 0)`
- **Structured reasoning:** Pass/fail explanations for transparency
- **Location:** `src/application/gates/funding_divergence.go`

#### 2. Microstructure & VADR Engine  
- **60s Rolling Calculations:** Spread/depth with rolling averages
- **VADR Precedence:** `max(p80(24h), tier.vadr_min)` with <20 bars freeze
- **Exchange-native Only:** Venue-specific validation, no aggregators
- **Location:** `internal/microstructure/`

#### 3. Gates & Precedence System
- **Freshness Precedence:** Worst-feed multiplier wins
- **Venue Health:** Cross-venue spread divergence detection, degraded mode support
- **Tiered Validation:** Depth/spread/VADR by liquidity tier
- **Location:** `internal/microstructure/gates.go`

#### 4. Derivatives Data Hardening
- **OI Math Safety:** Added `safeDelta(curr, prev float64) (float64, bool)`
- **Change24h Method:** `s.Change24h(prev *OpenInterestSnapshot) (float64, bool)`
- **Ring Buffer Logic:** Previous snapshot lookup for delta calculations
- **Location:** `internal/data/derivs/openinterest.go`

## Gate Reasons & Attribution

### Entry Gate Logic
- **Score Gate:** `Score ≥ 75` (hard requirement)
- **VADR Gate:** `VADR ≥ max(p80_24h, tier_minimum)` with precedence rules  
- **Funding Gate:** Venue-median Z with VWAP confirmation and CVD checks
- **Depth Gate:** Exchange-native depth within ±2% price bounds
- **Spread Gate:** Rolling 60s average ≤ tier caps

### Precedence Rules
- **Freshness:** Worst-feed multiplier wins (staleness aborts gate)
- **Venue Health:** ≥1 healthy venue for degraded mode, ≥2 for cross-checks
- **Data Quality:** Missing/stale feeds trigger appropriate fallback policies

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Build/Test/Vet Green:** All previous console errors resolved  
✅ **OI Type Safety:** String arithmetic eliminated, float64 conversions with safety  
✅ **Funding Divergence:** Venue-median Z + VWAP + CVD confirmation with reasons  
✅ **Microstructure/VADR:** Exchange-native gates with precedence enforcement  
✅ **Review Bundle:** PS-free zip creation with comprehensive analysis  

## Architecture Notes

- **Single Pipeline:** Maintained architectural consistency
- **Exchange-native Only:** Banned aggregators for microstructure data
- **Precedence Enforcement:** Freshness and venue health rules properly implemented
- **Explainability:** All gate results include structured reasoning

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Testing:** Validate P99 latency targets <300ms
2. **Integration Testing:** Test with live exchange feeds
3. **Conformance Suite:** Run D5 spec compliance tests
4. **Documentation:** Update API documentation with new gate logic
