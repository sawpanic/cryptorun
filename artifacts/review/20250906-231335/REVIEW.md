Real-time code review status tracking with comprehensive analysis: build results, test coverage, static analysis findings, and change impact assessment with full traceability.

## Overview

**Bundle Created**: 2025-09-06 23:13:35
**Branch**: feat/data-facade-hot-warm
**Base**: main (92e17987a1925c6a2d2a43be1b5c0eb88358fbe3)
**Repository**: https://github.com/sawpanic/cryptorun.git

## Branch Analysis

### Current State
- **Current Branch**: feat/data-facade-hot-warm
- **Merge Base**: 92e17987a1925c6a2d2a43be1b5c0eb88358fbe3
- **Commits Ahead**: 30 commits from base

### Key Changes Summary
Based on diff analysis, this branch contains major implementations:

1. **Microstructure Gates System**: Complete L1/L2 order book validation
2. **Premove Intelligence Module**: Pre-movement detection with scoring
3. **Regime Detection System**: 4-hour market regime classification 
4. **Provider Circuits**: Rate limiting and health monitoring
5. **Unified Scoring**: Single-path composite scoring system
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive system specifications

## Build & Test Status

### ‚ùå Build Status: FAILED
**Issues Found**:
- Multiple compilation errors across packages
- Type mismatches in internal/data/derivs
- Interface compliance issues in internal/application/pipeline
- Struct field conflicts in internal/application/guards/testkit

### ‚ùå Test Status: FAILED
**Key Issues**:
- Build failures prevent most tests from running
- Symbol normalization test failures in catalyst integration
- Coverage data unavailable due to compilation errors
- Timeout issues in some test suites

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Static Analysis: WARNINGS
**go vet Issues**:
- Unused variables and imports
- Type conversion issues
- Struct field duplication
- Missing method implementations

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Areas
1. **Type Safety**: Multiple type conversion issues
2. **Interface Compliance**: Missing method implementations
3. **Build Stability**: Core packages failing compilation
4. **Test Coverage**: Unable to measure due to build failures

### üü° Medium Risk Areas  
1. **Code Duplication**: Struct redeclarations
2. **Unused Code**: Dead imports and variables
3. **Documentation**: Some files missing UX MUST sections

### üü¢ Low Risk Areas
1. **Repository Structure**: Well-organized package layout
2. **Documentation Coverage**: Comprehensive system docs added
3. **Feature Completeness**: Major systems implemented

## Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
- **Build Breakage**: Must fix compilation errors before merge
- **Interface Mismatches**: Type system violations need resolution
- **Test Infrastructure**: Test failures blocking validation

### Moderate Issues
- **Code Cleanup**: Remove unused imports and variables
- **Type Consistency**: Resolve struct field conflicts  
- **Error Handling**: Some error paths not fully implemented

## Recommendations

### Before Merge (Critical)
1. **Fix Build Errors**: Address all compilation failures
2. **Resolve Type Issues**: Fix interface compliance problems
3. **Test Validation**: Ensure core tests pass
4. **Dependency Cleanup**: Remove unused imports

### Post-Merge (Important)
1. **Static Analysis**: Address remaining vet warnings
2. **Test Coverage**: Expand test coverage for new features
3. **Documentation**: Complete UX MUST sections for all docs
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate system under load

## File Changes Summary

See attached files for detailed analysis:
- `changed_files.txt`: Complete list of modified files
- `diff_stat.txt`: Line-by-line change statistics
- `diff_full.patch`: Complete unified diff
- `build.txt`: Full build output with errors
- `test.txt`: Test execution results
- `vet.txt`: Static analysis findings

## Conclusion

This branch represents significant feature development but requires **immediate attention to build issues** before it can be safely merged. The architectural vision is sound, but execution quality needs improvement to meet production standards.

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT MERGE** until build issues are resolved and core tests pass.
