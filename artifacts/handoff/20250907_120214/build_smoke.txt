BUILD SMOKE TEST RESULTS
======================

Build Status: FAILED
- Multiple syntax errors in datafacade middleware (imports placement)
- Unused variables in pit/store.go and other modules
- Undefined types/methods in adapter implementations
- Import path issues in signals module

Key Issues:
- infrastructure\datafacade\middleware\rate_limiter.go:448:1: syntax error: imports must appear before other declarations
- Multiple undefined interfaces.OpenInterestEvent references
- Missing cache methods and struct field mismatches
- Too many compilation errors to continue build

Recommendation: Fix syntax and interface definition issues before packaging
