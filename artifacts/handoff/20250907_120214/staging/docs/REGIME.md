# Regime Detector (4h Cadence) & Weight Blends

## UX MUST — Live Progress & Explainability

Real-time regime detection and adaptive weight blending: 4-hour cadence majority voting system using realized volatility, moving average analysis, and breadth thrust indicators to determine optimal factor weight allocations across Trending_Bull, Choppy, and High_Vol market regimes.

**Updated for PROMPT_ID=DOCS.FINISHER.UNIFIED.PIPELINE.V1**  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-07  
**Version:** v3.3 Unified Pipeline  
**Status:** Implemented

## Regime Detection System

### Inputs: realized_vol_7d, %>20MA, breadth_thrust; majority vote → {Trending_Bull, Choppy, High_Vol}.

The regime detector uses three independent indicators with majority voting to classify market conditions every 4 hours. This provides adaptive weight blending to optimize scoring for different market environments.

## Regime Detection (4h Cadence)

### Input Indicators

1. **Realized Volatility 7d** - 7-day realized volatility measure
   - **High volatility threshold**: >25% annualized
   - **Vote**: "high_vol" if above threshold, otherwise "low_vol"

2. **% Above 20MA** - Percentage of top-50 assets above 20-day moving average  
   - **Trending threshold**: >60% above 20MA
   - **Vote**: "trending_bull" if above threshold, otherwise "choppy"

3. **Breadth Thrust (ADX Proxy)** - Market momentum breadth indicator
   - **Momentum threshold**: >70% thrust reading  
   - **Vote**: "trending_bull" if above threshold, otherwise "choppy"

### Majority Voting Logic

```go
votes := map[string]int{
    "trending_bull": 0,
    "choppy": 0, 
    "high_vol": 0,
}

// Count votes from all three indicators
for _, vote := range indicatorVotes {
    votes[vote]++
}

// Majority winner becomes regime
regime = argmax(votes)
confidence = maxVotes / totalVotes
```

### Regime Classifications

- **TRENDING_BULL**: Strong directional momentum with broad participation
- **CHOPPY**: Sideways/range-bound markets with mixed signals
- **HIGH_VOL**: High volatility regardless of direction

## Weight Blends

### Trending_Bull: Momentum 40–45 (24h 10–15; 7d 5–10), Catalyst 12–15, Technical 18–22, Volume 15–20, Quality 5–10.

**Characteristics**: Strong directional momentum with broad participation
**Strategy**: Emphasize momentum and catalyst factors

```yaml
momentum_core: 42.5       # 40-45% range
  momentum_24h: 12.5      # 10-15% sub-allocation
  momentum_7d: 7.5        # 5-10% sub-allocation
  momentum_other: 22.5    # Remaining 1h/4h/12h timeframes
catalyst: 13.5            # 12-15% range
technical: 20.0           # 18-22% range
volume: 17.5              # 15-20% range
quality: 7.5              # 5-10% range
movement_threshold: 2.5   # ≥2.5% price movement required
```

### Choppy: Momentum 25–30 (24h 5–8; 7d ≤2), Catalyst 18–22, Technical 22–28, Volume 15–20, Quality 10–15.

**Characteristics**: Mixed signals, range-bound action
**Strategy**: Emphasize technical and quality factors for mean reversion

```yaml
momentum_core: 27.5       # 25-30% range
  momentum_24h: 6.5       # 5-8% sub-allocation
  momentum_7d: 1.0        # ≤2% sub-allocation (minimal longer-term)
  momentum_other: 20.0    # Focus on shorter timeframes
catalyst: 20.0            # 18-22% range
technical: 25.0           # 22-28% range (increased for mean reversion)
volume: 17.5              # 15-20% range
quality: 12.5             # 10-15% range (increased stability focus)
movement_threshold: 3.0   # ≥3.0% price movement required
```

### High_Vol: Momentum 28–35, Quality 30–35, Technical 20–25; tighten movement gates to 3–4%.

**Characteristics**: High volatility, defensive positioning
**Strategy**: Emphasize quality and tighten risk controls

```yaml
momentum_core: 31.5       # 28-35% range
catalyst: 10.0            # Reduced due to noise in volatile markets
technical: 22.5           # 20-25% range
volume: 17.5              # 15-20% range (liquidity critical)
quality: 32.5             # 30-35% range (stability crucial)
movement_threshold: 4.0   # Tighten to 3-4% (vs 2.5% bull / 3.0% chop)
risk_multiplier: 1.3      # Increase risk controls by 30%
```

## Multi-Timeframe Momentum Weights

The MomentumCore factor uses regime-specific timeframe weighting:

### Trending Bull
```yaml
1h: 0.20   # 20% - Short-term momentum
4h: 0.35   # 35% - Primary timeframe
12h: 0.30  # 30% - Medium-term trend
24h: 0.12  # 12% - Daily trend (10-15% range)
7d: 0.08   # 8% - Weekly trend (5-10% range)
```

### Choppy Market
```yaml
1h: 0.15   # 15% - Reduced short-term noise
4h: 0.30   # 30% - Primary timeframe
12h: 0.40  # 40% - Longer-term focus
24h: 0.07  # 7% - Daily (5-8% range)
7d: 0.02   # 2% - Weekly (≤2% range)
```

### High Volatility
```yaml
1h: 0.25   # 25% - Higher short-term sensitivity
4h: 0.40   # 40% - Strong 4h focus
12h: 0.25  # 25% - Reduced medium-term
24h: 0.10  # 10% - Daily trend
7d: 0.00   # 0% - No weekly in high vol
```

## Entry Gates by Regime

All regimes enforce the core entry gates with regime-specific movement thresholds:

### Common Gates (All Regimes)
- **Composite Score**: ≥75 (universal)
- **VADR**: ≥1.75× (freeze if <20 bars)
- **Liquidity**: ≥$500k daily volume
- **Trend Quality**: ADX >25 OR Hurst >0.55
- **Freshness**: ≤2 bars, late-fill <30s

### Emits: regime, confidence, last_update (UTC).

```go
type RegimeStatus struct {
    CurrentRegime    RegimeType    `json:"current_regime"`    // "Trending_Bull" | "Choppy" | "High_Vol"
    Confidence       float64       `json:"confidence"`        // 0.33-1.0 based on vote unanimity
    LastUpdate       time.Time     `json:"last_update"`       // UTC timestamp
    NextUpdate       time.Time     `json:"next_update"`       // Next 4h evaluation
    WeightProfile    WeightBlend   `json:"weight_profile"`    // Active weight allocation
}
```

### Regime-Specific Movement Thresholds
- **TRENDING_BULL**: ≥2.5% price movement
- **CHOPPY**: ≥3.0% price movement
- **HIGH_VOL**: ≥4.0% price movement (tightened)

## Stability and Transition Logic

### Update Frequency
- **Cadence**: Every 4 hours (00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC)
- **Stability Check**: Regime considered stable if no changes in last 2 cycles (8 hours)
- **Hysteresis**: Built-in noise tolerance to prevent regime whipsaws

### Transition Handling
```go
// Example regime transition handling
if newRegime != currentRegime {
    change := RegimeChange{
        Timestamp:   time.Now(),
        FromRegime:  currentRegime,
        ToRegime:    newRegime, 
        Confidence:  confidence,
        TriggerHour: time.Now().Hour(),
    }
    
    // Update weights immediately
    scorer.UpdateRegimeWeights(newRegime)
    
    // Log transition for analysis
    regimeHistory = append(regimeHistory, change)
}
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DetectorInputs Interface** - Market data provider
   ```go
   type DetectorInputs interface {
       GetRealizedVolatility7d(ctx) (float64, error)
       GetBreadthAbove20MA(ctx) (float64, error)  
       GetBreadthThrustADXProxy(ctx) (float64, error)
       GetTimestamp(ctx) (time.Time, error)
   }
   ```

2. **Detector** - Main regime classification engine
   ```go
   type Detector struct {
       config        DetectorConfig
       inputs        DetectorInputs
       lastResult    *DetectionResult
       changeHistory []RegimeChange
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Points**
   - **Unified Scorer**: `UnifiedScorer.calculateMomentumCore()` uses regime weights
   - **Entry Gates**: `EntryGateEvaluator.EvaluateEntry()` applies regime thresholds
   - **CLI Menu**: Displays current regime with confidence in status badges

### Configuration

```go
type DetectorConfig struct {
    UpdateIntervalHours    int     // 4 hours
    RealizedVolThreshold   float64 // 25% (0.25)
    BreadthThreshold       float64 // 60% (0.60) 
    BreadthThrustThreshold float64 // 70% (0.70)
    MinSamplesRequired     int     // 3 minimum
}
```
