# Exit Rules and Logic

This document describes the comprehensive exit evaluation system for CryptoRun positions, including rule precedence, trigger conditions, and operational procedures.

## UX MUST â€” Live Progress & Explainability

All exit evaluations provide clear reasoning with specific trigger values, precedence explanations, and detailed position metrics for transparent decision-making.

## Exit System Overview

The exit system continuously monitors open positions and applies exit rules in strict precedence order. Exit evaluation is **deterministic** - higher precedence rules always override lower ones.

**Core Principle**: Exit immediately when any rule triggers, with reason attribution and timing metrics.

## Exit Rule Precedence

Exit rules are evaluated in strict order from highest to lowest precedence:

1. **Hard Stop** (Highest) - Absolute loss protection
2. **Venue Health Cut** - Exchange performance degradation  
3. **Time Limit** - Maximum hold duration (48h default)
4. **Acceleration Reversal** - Momentum dynamics deterioration
5. **Momentum Fade** - Score degradation from entry
6. **Trailing Stop** - Profit protection mechanism
7. **Profit Target** (Lowest) - Systematic profit taking

**Critical**: Once any rule triggers, evaluation stops - higher precedence rules always win.

## Exit Rule Specifications

### 1. Hard Stop (Precedence: Highest)
```yaml
description: "Absolute loss protection at predetermined price level"
trigger: "current_price â‰¤ hard_stop_price"
rationale: "Capital preservation takes precedence over all other considerations"
```

**Configuration**:
- Stop loss price calculated at position entry
- Typically 4-6% below entry price depending on volatility regime
- Cannot be disabled - always active for capital protection

### 2. Venue Health Cut (Precedence: 2nd)
```yaml
description: "Exit when exchange performance degrades significantly"
triggers:
  - "P99 latency > 2000ms"
  - "error_rate > 3.0%"  
  - "reject_rate > 5.0%"
logic: "OR (any condition triggers exit)"
rationale: "Cannot trade effectively on degraded venues"
```

### 3. Time Limit (Precedence: 3rd)
```yaml
description: "Maximum position hold duration"
trigger: "hours_held â‰¥ max_hold_hours"
default: 48.0  # hours
rationale: "Prevents indefinite holds, forces periodic re-evaluation"
```

### 4. Acceleration Reversal (Precedence: 4th)
```yaml
description: "Momentum acceleration has declined significantly"
trigger: "acceleration_change â‰¤ -50%"
calculation: "((current_accel / entry_accel) - 1.0) * 100"
threshold: -50.0  # percent decline
rationale: "Momentum dynamics deteriorating, trend weakening"
```

### 5. Momentum Fade (Precedence: 5th)
```yaml
description: "Composite momentum score has faded from entry"
trigger: "momentum_change â‰¤ -30%"
calculation: "((current_score / entry_score) - 1.0) * 100"
threshold: -30.0  # percent decline
rationale: "Underlying momentum factors weakening"
```

### 6. Trailing Stop (Precedence: 6th)
```yaml
description: "Protect profits by following high water mark"
trigger: "current_price â‰¤ (high_water_mark Ã— (1 - trailing_pct/100))"
default_trailing_pct: 5.0  # 5% trailing distance
requirements:
  - "high_water_mark > entry_price"  # Must have profits first
  - "enable_trailing_stop: true"
```

### 7. Profit Target (Precedence: Lowest)
```yaml
description: "Systematic profit taking at predetermined levels"
targets:
  target_1: 15.0  # 15% profit
  target_2: 30.0  # 30% profit
logic: "Check target_2 first (higher target takes precedence)"
calculation: "target_price = entry_price Ã— (1 + target_pct/100)"
```

## Configuration Examples

### Default Exit Configuration
```yaml
# Hard stop
enable_hard_stop: true

# Venue health thresholds  
max_venue_p99_latency_ms: 2000  # 2 seconds
max_venue_error_rate: 3.0       # 3%
max_venue_reject_rate: 5.0      # 5%

# Time management
default_max_hold_hours: 48.0    # 48 hours

# Momentum thresholds
momentum_fade_threshold: 30.0   # 30% decline
accel_reversal_threshold: 50.0  # 50% decline

# Trailing stop
enable_trailing_stop: true
default_trailing_pct: 5.0       # 5%

# Profit targets
enable_profit_targets: true
default_profit_target_1: 15.0   # 15%
default_profit_target_2: 30.0   # 30%
```

### High-Volatility Regime Adjustments
```yaml
default_trailing_pct: 7.0       # Wider trailing (7% vs 5%)
momentum_fade_threshold: 25.0   # Stricter fade threshold (25% vs 30%)
max_venue_p99_latency_ms: 1500  # Tighter latency (1.5s vs 2s)
```

## Exit Result Format

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSD",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z", 
  "should_exit": true,
  "exit_reason": "hard_stop",
  "reason_string": "hard_stop",
  "triggered_by": "Price 47800.00 â‰¤ stop 48000.00",
  "current_price": 47800.00,
  "entry_price": 50000.00,
  "unrealized_pnl": -4.4,
  "hours_held": 3.2,
  "evaluation_time_ms": 12
}
```

## Exit Evaluation Process

### Evaluation Flow
1. Calculate position metrics (PnL, duration, etc.)
2. Check Hard Stop â†’ EXIT if triggered  
3. Check Venue Health â†’ EXIT if triggered
4. Check Time Limit â†’ EXIT if triggered
5. Check Acceleration Reversal â†’ EXIT if triggered  
6. Check Momentum Fade â†’ EXIT if triggered
7. Check Trailing Stop â†’ EXIT if triggered
8. Check Profit Targets â†’ EXIT if triggered
9. If no exits triggered â†’ HOLD position

### Short-Circuit Logic
- **First rule match wins** - evaluation stops at first trigger
- Higher precedence rules **always** override lower ones
- No combination logic - single rule determines exit

## Testing and Integration

### Unit Test Coverage
- âœ… Each exit rule triggers independently with correct precedence
- âœ… Multiple conditions met â†’ highest precedence wins
- âœ… All exit rules can be disabled/enabled via configuration
- âœ… Position metrics calculated correctly (PnL, duration)
- âœ… Thresholds properly configurable and validated

### API Integration
```go
import "cryptorun/internal/exits"

evaluator := exits.NewExitEvaluator(exits.DefaultExitConfig())

inputs := exits.ExitInputs{
    Symbol:       "BTCUSD",
    EntryPrice:   50000.0,
    CurrentPrice: 52000.0,
    EntryTime:    entryTime,
    CurrentTime:  time.Now(),
    HardStopPrice: 48000.0,
}

result, err := evaluator.EvaluateExit(ctx, inputs)
if result.ShouldExit {
    fmt.Printf("ðŸšª Exit: %s\n", result.TriggeredBy)
}
```
