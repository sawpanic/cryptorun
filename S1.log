## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è SCHED.LOOP.SIGNALS Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the production scheduler with hot/warm signal loops and regime refresh according to the prompt specifications:

### ‚úÖ **Completed Components**

1. **Scheduler Engine** (`internal/scheduler/schedule.go`)
   - RegisterInterval and RegisterCron functions
   - StartAll with ¬±7s jitter and next-run logging
   - Graceful shutdown and job management

2. **Hot Signals Loop** (`internal/application/scan/hot.go`)
   - RunUniverse with top-30 universe, regime-aware weights
   - MomentumCore protection (1h/4h/12h/24h = 20/35/30/10 + acceleration)
   - Freshness gate (‚â§2 bars & ‚â§1.2√óATR)
   - Fatigue guard (24h>+12% & RSI4h>70 unless accel‚Üë)
   - Venue-native L1/L2 microstructure validation
   - Attribution with [Fresh ‚óè] [Depth ‚úì] [Venue] [Sources n] columns

3. **Warm Signals Loop** (`internal/application/scan/warm.go`)
   - REST+cache strategy with reconciliation
   - Relaxed thresholds for broader discovery
   - Cache hit rate monitoring

4. **Regime Refresh** (`internal/application/regime/refresh.go`)
   - 3-indicator system: realized_vol_7d, %>20MA, breadth_thrust
   - Majority vote logic with confidence scoring
   - 4h cache expiry with GetCurrentRegime()

5. **Menu Integration** (`cmd/cryptorun/menu_signals.go`)
   - Regime/API banner with health status
   - Manual loop execution functions

6. **Artifacts System** (`internal/output/artifacts.go`)
   - signals.csv, premove.csv, explain.json output
   - Timestamped artifact directories

7. **Scheduler CLI** (`cmd/cryptorun/cmd_schedule.go`)
   - start/list/enable/disable commands
   - Job registration for all 3 loops

8. **Tests**
   - Integration tests for VADR freeze, freshness gates, aggregator bans
   - Unit tests for regime vote toggles and cache timestamps

9. **Documentation Updates**
   - Enhanced SCHEDULER.md with live loops architecture
   - Updated BENCHMARKS.md with performance targets

### ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria Met**

- **3 Jobs Scheduled**: Hot (15m), Warm (2h), Regime (4h) ‚úÖ
- **Hot Loop Output**: Deterministic attribution with [Fresh ‚óè] [Depth ‚úì] [Venue] columns ‚úÖ  
- **Deterministic Gates**: Clear reasons in explain.json artifacts ‚úÖ
- **VADR Freeze**: <20 bars detection implemented ‚úÖ
- **No Aggregators**: Venue-native enforcement (KRA/BIN/CB/OKX only) ‚úÖ
- **Artifact Emission**: Timestamped CSV/JSON per cycle ‚úÖ

The implementation provides a complete production-ready signal scheduler with regime-aware momentum scanning, proper gate attribution, and comprehensive artifact output for tracking and analysis.
